Hello someone who is reading this.
This is a note which I have made, Because I am in my worst state.
I'm ugly, lonely, I have forgot how feeling cared is.
I have rage issues, Which never help my mental state.
Anything I do, I get negative feedback. I want this to stop.
I would kill myself, But I'll just seem more like a loser to my parents.
I hope my life gets better soon.

Just give me a chance.
